                    <td>Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that third-party resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing developers to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched file must match. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Third-party resources (such as scripts and stylesheets) can be manipulated. An attacker that has access or has hacked the hosting CDN can manipulate or replace the files. SRI allows developers to specify a base64-encoded cryptographic hash of the resource to be loaded. The integrity attribute containing the hash is then added to the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; HTML element tag. The integrity string consists of a base64-encoded hash, followed by a prefix that depends on the hash algorithm. This prefix can either be sha256, sha384 or sha512. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The script loaded from the external URL specified in the Details section doesn&#39;t implement Subresource Integrity (SRI). It&#39;s recommended to implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all the scripts loaded from external hosts.</td>
                    <td>Use the SRI Hash Generator link (from the References section) to generate a &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; element that implements Subresource Integrity (SRI). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

For example, you can use the following &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; element to tell a browser that before executing the https://example.com/example-framework.js script, the browser must first compare the script to the expected hash, and verify that there&#39;s a match.

Several popular text editors like Vim and Emacs automatically create backup copies of the files you edit, giving them names like &amp;quot;wp-config.php~&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;#wp-config.php#&amp;quot;. If the text editor crashes or the SSH connection drops during editing, then the temporary backup files may not be cleaned up correctly. Also, sometimes developers create this type of files to backup their work or by administrators when making backups of the web server. Most servers, including Apache, will serve the plaintext of .php~ and .php# files without passing them through the PHP preprocessor first, since they don&#39;t have the .php file extension.</td>
