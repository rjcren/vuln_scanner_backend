Content Security Policy (CSP) can be implemented by adding a &lt;strong&gt;Content-Security-Policy&lt;/strong&gt; header. The value of this header is a string containing the policy directives describing your Content Security Policy. To implement CSP, you should define lists of allowed origins for the all of the types of resources that your site utilizes. For example, if you have a simple site that needs to load scripts, stylesheets, and images hosted locally, as well as from the jQuery library from their CDN, the CSP header could look like the following:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Content-Security-Policy:
    default-src &#39;self&#39;;
    script-src &#39;self&#39; https://code.jquery.com;

The server didn&#39;t return a &lt;strong&gt;frame-ancestors&lt;/strong&gt; directive in the Content-Security-Policy header which means that this website could be at risk of a clickjacking attack. The frame-ancestors directives can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.</td>

                    <td>Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that third-party resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing developers to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched file must match. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Third-party resources (such as scripts and stylesheets) can be manipulated. An attacker that has access or has hacked the hosting CDN can manipulate or replace the files. SRI allows developers to specify a base64-encoded cryptographic hash of the resource to be loaded. The integrity attribute containing the hash is then added to the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; HTML element tag. The integrity string consists of a base64-encoded hash, followed by a prefix that depends on the hash algorithm. This prefix can either be sha256, sha384 or sha512. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The script loaded from the external URL specified in the Details section doesn&#39;t implement Subresource Integrity (SRI). It&#39;s recommended to implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all the scripts loaded from external hosts.</td>

For example, you can use the following &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; element to tell a browser that before executing the https://example.com/example-framework.js script, the browser must first compare the script to the expected hash, and verify that there&#39;s a match.

If the text editor crashes or the SSH connection drops during editing, then the temporary backup files may not be cleaned up correctly. Also, sometimes developers create this type of files to backup their work or by administrators when making backups of the web server.
